# Japanese support

This purpose of this add-on is to automatically generate and bulk-generate furigana readings.
To do its job, the add-on relies on
[mecab_controller](https://github.com/Ajatt-Tools/mecab_controller).
Initially this add-on was forked from
[Japanese Support](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/3918629684)
by Damien Elmes, but was almost completely rewritten.

The add-on comes with
[Japanese sentences](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1557722832)
note type optimized for usage with
[targeted sentence cards](https://tatsumoto-ren.github.io/blog/discussing-various-card-templates.html#targeted-sentence-cards-or-mpvacious-cards).
